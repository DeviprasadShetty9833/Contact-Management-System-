# Overview:

<br> This is a simple yet effective Contact Management System built in C, focusing on practical use of File Handling.
<br> The system allows users to manage a contact list — add, view, delete contacts — while ensuring data is stored persistently in a file.
<br> 
<br> Additionally, it implements an Undo Last Deletion feature using a temporary backup mechanism to restore accidentally deleted contacts.
<br> 

# Key Features:

<br> ![1.](https://img.shields.io/badge/1.-Add%20Contact-00599C?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=white)
<br> Add new contacts (Name, Phone Number, Email, etc.) to the system.
<br> The contact data is saved persistently using text/binary file storage.
<br> 
<br> ![2.](https://img.shields.io/badge/2.-View%20Contacts-00599C?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=white)
<br> Display all saved contacts by reading from the file.
<br> Ensures that the latest state of the contact list is shown.
<br> 
<br> ![3.](https://img.shields.io/badge/3.-Delete%20Contact-00599C?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=white)
<br> Remove a contact based on a unique identifier (like name or phone number).
<br> Updates the file after deletion to maintain consistency.
<br> 
<br> ![4.](https://img.shields.io/badge/4.-Undo%20Last%20Deleted%20Contact-00599C?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=white)
<br> Before any delete operation, the deleted contact is temporarily stored.
<br> Allows restoring the last deleted contact with a simple undo operation.
<br> 

# Concepts Used:

<br> Programming Language: C (Standard C99)

<br> Core Concepts:
<br> ⊡⁠ File Handling (fopen, fread, fwrite, fseek, fprintf, fscanf)
<br> ⊡⁠ Temporary backup for Undo functionality
<br> ⊡⁠ Command Line Interface (CLI)
<br> ⊡⁠ Dynamic Memory Management (malloc, free)
<br> 

# File Format:

<br> Text File (.txt) or Binary File (.bin) for storing contact information persistently.

# How to use:

<br> 1. Copy the source code from the file : [src.c](https://github.com/DeviprasadShetty9833/Contact_Management_System/blob/main/src.c) 
<br> 2. Open any of the recommended online C compilers : (e.g., [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/c-online-compiler), [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/c.html#mode=edit), [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler), [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/), [OneCompiler](https://onecompiler.com/c), etc.)
<br> 3. Paste the copied code into the editor.
<br> 4. Click the **RUN** / **Visualise Execution** button to execute the program.
<br> 5. Menu : Enter a natural number between 1 to 5.
<br> 6. View the output — a visually structured cube pattern is displayed in the console output panel, as shown below 👇 in the examples of Output.
