# Overview:

<br> This is a simple yet effective Contact Management System built in C, focusing on practical use of File Handling.
<br> The system allows users to manage a contact list ‚Äî add, view, delete contacts ‚Äî while ensuring data is stored persistently in a file.
<br> 
<br> Additionally, it implements an Undo Last Deletion feature using a temporary backup mechanism to restore accidentally deleted contacts.
<br> 

# Key Features:
